## Notice
- I do not guarantee 100% coverage of the project within this documentation. If there is really something needed to be added, see [Contributing](#Contributing).
- **App Config**: Please configure `auth.ts`. Get its template from `auth.example.ts`.
  - It can be found at `src/auth` folder.
- **MariaDB**: Import database schema to your created database (default: `kamihimedb`) with `utf8_unicode_ci` collation.
    - The `db.zip` file will not be updated for every new character release. It only serves as a starting kit for running the website.
- **Util/Scenario**: If you found non-existent files that causes error on any story/scenario, please report [here](https://gist.github.com/gazmull/45cd187e4a476795bcef630a8018e1a6).
    - Once the reported files are added, you may do `$ yarn run scenarios-v` again. See [Procedures-3](#Procedures) for more info.
- **Package Manager**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) is recommended.

## Procedures
1. Read [Requirements](#Requirements) and [Notice](#Notice)
2. Execute `$ yarn`
    - You have to build the src too: `$ yarn --production=false`
3. Execute `$ yarn run scenarios` to generate episode resources
    - Or `$ yarn run scenarios-v` to run with verbose logging
    - Append `-l#` or `--latest=#` to generate episode resources based on the number provided (e.g: 5 is for 5 characters). `#` is for a number.
        - This is not compatible with `--id`.
        - e.g: `-l5` or `--latest=5`
    - Append `-i{{id}}` or `--id={{id}}` to generate episode resources based on the character provided. `{{id}}` is for a character ID.
        - This is not compatible with `--latest`.
        - e.g.: `-ik0001` or `--id=k0001`
4. Execute `$ yarn run build`
5. Execute `$ node .`
    - `$ yarn run pm2` for PM2 preference / production stage
    - `$ yarn run pm2-bind` for Debian-based server. [`authbind`](#Requirements) must be installed.
